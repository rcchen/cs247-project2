			<h3>Needfinding: Users and the Context of Use</h3>
			<p>In the process of discovering our unique public experience, we observed that the experience of waiting in line offered an opportunity for transforming static, passive time, into something collaborative, creative, and much more interesting.</p>
			<p>Waiting in line is very rarely enjoyable and even less so because of the perception that one is wasting otherwise valuable time while standing in a line. Consider that standing is not conducive to working on a computer, for instance, or even reading a book long enough to make it through more than a few chapters. Moreover, a sense of unfamiliarity often accompanies this feeling of helpless unproductivity due to an immersion among strangers that one tends to be standing next to while waiting in a line.</p>
			<p>Our observations and conversations coupled with personal experiences provided an insight into an unmet need. A representative comment about standing in lines we noted was, "I HATE STANDING IN LINES. I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING TO DO. ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING". Wouldn't it be much better to engage in something creative, simply fun, and collaborative rather than passively wait whilst surrounded by strangers who you're not sure are interested in talking to you?</p>

			<h3>Sketching</h3>
			<p>Before touching a single line of code, our group got together and brainstormed a bunch of ideas. At the core, our goal was to design and build an activity that was interesting and entertaining. When we delve into the essence of our mission, the need we are targeting is really people's seemingly inherent thirst to be entertained and violent aversion to undesired inactivity (i.e. boredom). Here are some of the ideas that we had during our brainstorming portion of the assignment. We have also included some of our insights as well as how they (do not quite) address user needs and behavior.</p>
